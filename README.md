# niyamr-fullstack-assignment
A full-stack PDF rule-checking app that lets users upload a PDF, enter three natural-language rules, and get AI-powered PASS/FAIL results with evidence, reasoning, and confidence scores. Includes PDF text extraction, LLM evaluation, clean UI, and backend API. Built for the NIYAMR AI assignment
📄 LLM-Powered PDF Rule Validation System

A lightweight, production-ready full-stack application designed to evaluate PDF documents against natural-language rules using a Large Language Model (LLM).
The system extracts text from an uploaded PDF and performs semantic checks to determine whether the document satisfies user-defined criteria.

Built as part of the NIYAMR AI Full-Stack Developer Assignment, this project demonstrates practical integration of AI reasoning, PDF parsing, and a modern frontend–backend architecture.

🔍 Key Capabilities

PDF Upload Interface — Supports documents between 2–10 pages

Dynamic Rule Input — Users can specify three custom rules in natural language

AI-Driven Evaluation — Each rule is processed through an LLM for:

PASS / FAIL classification

Evidence extraction

Concise reasoning

Confidence scoring

Results Dashboard — Clear, structured output table for fast interpretation

🏗️ Architecture Overview

Frontend

Clean UI for PDF uploads, rule inputs, and result visualization

Built with HTML/CSS/JS or React (depending on implementation)

Backend

PDF text extraction pipeline

LLM prompt-engineering and evaluation logic

REST API for receiving files and returning structured results

Developed using Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI/Flask)

🤖 AI Integration

The application uses an LLM (such as OpenAI, Gemini, or Claude) to simulate expert-level document analysis by:

Understanding natural-language rules

Interpreting document context

Returning explainable PASS/FAIL outcomes

Generating sentence-level evidence

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This solution demonstrates:

End-to-end full-stack development

Working with file uploads and PDF extraction

Integrating LLMs into real-world workflows

Producing structured, interpretable AI outputs

Delivering a clean, functional UI within a compressed development timeline
